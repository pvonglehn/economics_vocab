That is, words which are common in economics texts but uncommon in general texts and which cannot be easily guessed by a Spanish speaker. \n",

    "### Problem:\n",
    "A friend is preparing for an English exam as part of her studies to become an economist for the civil service in Spain. Part of the exam will be based on an article from the International Monetary Fund <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/\">finance and development magazine</a>, or a similar publication. She finds that she is lacking much of the economics specific vocabulary necessary to understand these articles. \n",
    "\n",
    "The classic strategy for improving vocabulary is to read a lot and look up words that you don't know. However, this approach is very inefficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider an example.\n",
    "The student reads the sentence:<br>\n",
    "'Higher <strong>wages</strong> in China make <strong>offshoring</strong> less attractive.'\n",
    "\n",
    "The student may not know the meaning of 'wages' or 'offshoring' so their instinct might be to look up and learn both. What the student doesn't know however, is that while the word 'wage' is very common in financial texts and definitely worth learning,  the word 'offshoring' is much less common, so it is not worth the student's effort learning, at least as long as there are many more useful words they could learn first."

    "Below is a table showing the first 5 words in the final list. The imf_rank indicates each word's rank based on its frequency of occurrence in the imf magazine. This corpus was compiled during this project and consists of over two million tokens (words) from over 100,000 sentences from over 1000 articles. The general rank indicates the word's position on a list of 5000 English words ordered by their frequency of occurence in a large corpus constructed from a wide range of English texts. This list was downloaded from https://www.wordfrequency.info/ \n",

We can see that the top words in our list occur much more frequently in the economics corpus than in general English. This indicates that these words are very important to know in order to understand these texts, but students may not know them because they are relatively uncommon in general texts that they will mostly have been exposed to in their English studies. \n",
