    "### Problem:\n",
    "A friend is preparing for an English exam as part of her studies to become an economist for the civil service in Spain. Part of the exam will be based on an article from International Monetary Fund <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/\">finance and development magazine</a>, or a similar publication. She finds that she is lacking much of the economics specific vocabulary necessary to understand these articles. \n",

    "'Higher <strong>wages</strong> in China make <strong>offshoring</strong> less attractive.'\n",
    "\n",
    "The student may not know the meaning of 'wages' or 'offshoring' so their instinct might be to look up and learn both. What the student doesn't know however, is that while the word 'wage' is very common in financial texts and definitely worth learning,  the word 'offshoring' is much less common, so it is not worth the student's effort learning, at least as long as there are many more useful words they could learn first."
