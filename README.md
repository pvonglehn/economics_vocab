This is a project to help a friend improve her economics specific English vocabulary.
The result is a list of the most common, economics specific English words which don't have Spanish cognates. 
That is, words which are common in economics texts but uncommon in general texts and which cannot be easily guessed by a Spanish speaker. 

The project is documented in the jupyter notebook 'Blanca.ipynb' which can be viewed here:
